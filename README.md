Task 2: Customer Segmentation using K-Means
Objective

The goal of this task is to segment retail store customers based on their purchase history using K-Means clustering. This helps the business understand buying patterns and tailor marketing strategies for different customer groups.

Dataset

The dataset contains historical purchase information of customers, including features like:

Total purchase amount

Frequency of purchases

Product categories bought

(Optional) You can add your dataset here or provide a link if the dataset is too large to upload.

Steps Followed

Data Exploration

Loaded the dataset and checked for missing or inconsistent values.

Analyzed key features to understand customer behavior.

Data Preprocessing

Normalized the data to improve clustering performance.

Handled any missing values or outliers.

K-Means Clustering

Applied K-Means to group customers into distinct clusters.

Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Visualization & Interpretation

Plotted clusters to visualize customer segments.

Analyzed centroids to interpret typical customer behavior for each group.

Output

Scatter plots showing customer clusters.

Elbow plot to determine optimal number of clusters.

Cluster centroids representing typical customer profiles.

Key Takeaways

Unsupervised learning like K-Means is powerful for discovering hidden patterns in customer data.

Data preprocessing and visualization are critical for meaningful clustering results.

Customer segmentation can inform targeted marketing and personalized promotions.
